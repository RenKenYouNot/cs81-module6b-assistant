What made your assistant “personal” to you?
My assistant felt personal because I customized its tasks to reflect my actual routines.
This made the simulation feel relevant and relatable to my daily routine.

What challenges did you face using this?
The main challenge with this was ensuring it always referred to the correct PersonalAssistant instance within each method, 
especially when first learning how prototype methods are linked back to the object.

Which method would you improve or expand?
I would improve the completeTask method by adding a way to specify which task to complete, rather than always removing the first one.
This would make the task management more flexible and user-friendly.
